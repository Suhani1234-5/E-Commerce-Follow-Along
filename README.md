Milestone 3 - Backend Setup and Integration
Overview
In this milestone, you will set up the foundational elements for your backend. You'll organize your backend code efficiently, configure a Node.js server to handle API requests, connect to MongoDB for data management, and implement basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation. By the end of this milestone, your application will be able to handle requests and store data in MongoDB with proper error feedback.

Tasks
1. Backend Folder Structure üóÇÔ∏è
Create dedicated folders for organizing your backend code. This includes:

routes: Handles routing of incoming requests.
controllers: Contains the logic for handling requests.
models: Defines the structure and schema of your data (MongoDB).
middlewares: Used for functions that run during the request-response cycle (e.g., validation, logging).
utils: Utility functions that may be used across the backend code.
Note: Terms like ‚Äúmiddleware‚Äù and ‚Äúutils‚Äù will be explored more in-depth as you progress in the course.

2. Server Setup üñ•Ô∏è
Use Node.js and Express to create the backend server.

Configure the server to listen on a designated port (e.g., 5000 or 3000).

Steps:

Install necessary dependencies like express using npm.
Create an Express app and set up a basic route to ensure your server is running.
3. Database Connection üíæ
Integrate MongoDB with your application to store and manage data.
Use the mongoose library to define schemas and models.
Connect the backend server to MongoDB and ensure the connection is successful.
Test database connection by saving a test document or retrieving data from a collection.
4. Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è
Implement basic error handling to help with debugging and user feedback.
Create a middleware to handle common errors (e.g., 404 for routes that don‚Äôt exist, 500 for server issues).
Ensure that error messages are clear and helpful for both the developer and the user.
5. Documentation üìñ
Update your README file to reflect the progress you've made in this milestone.
Provide instructions for setting up and running the backend server.
Document key components of the backend, such as how the server is structured, how MongoDB is integrated, and how to handle errors.

Milestone 7: User Login Endpoint üåü
Overview
In this milestone, we created a backend endpoint for user login functionality. The focus was on validating user credentials and securely verifying the encrypted passwords stored in the database.

Key Achievements üéØ
Validated User Credentials: Implemented functionality to accept and process user login requests.
Encrypted Password Verification: Used bcrypt to securely compare hashed passwords stored in the database with the user‚Äôs input.
Error Handling: Added robust error handling for scenarios where users are not found or the password does not match.
Why Password Encryption Matters
Protect User Data: Ensures that passwords remain secure even if the database is compromised.
Privacy: Prevents plain-text storage of sensitive information.
Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
Prevents Password Theft: Hashing makes it nearly impossible for attackers to reverse-engineer passwords.
How Login Authentication Works üîë
User Enters Credentials:

The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database:

The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.
If the user is not found, an error is returned: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords:

Hash the user's input password using the same algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Compare the resulting hash with the stored hashed password.
Authenticate the user if the hashes match; otherwise, return an error.
Steps Implemented in Milestone 7 üìù
Login Endpoint:

Created a backend route to handle user login requests.
Accepted email/username and password as inputs.
Password Validation:

Used bcrypt to securely hash and compare passwords.
Returned appropriate success or failure responses.
Database Interaction:

Retrieved user data from the database based on the input credentials.
Verified if the user exists and validated their credentials.
